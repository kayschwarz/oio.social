The Open Infrastructure Marina *(also: the Marina/the Orbit)* is a safe haven for all groups and individuals dealing with and building open infrastructure. During the year we are on the move in different waters. Once a year we meet for the 35c3 in our port *(marina)* to exchange our experiences over the last year, as well as our vision for the coming years.

The marina is located in the centre of Hall 2, the Assembly of the 35th Chaos Communication Congress.

We have a stage with presentations, boats with seats where you can meet the various participants in our marina and a workshop room. We also have a lounge and a spot for stickers. See our program [here](https://talks.oio.social/36c3-oio/ "Pretalx 36c3 Open Infrastructure Orbit") and come by!

Further information to the open Infrastructure Orbit and/or Marina can be found in our Wiki on [wiki.freifunk.net/36c3](https://wiki.freifunk.net/36c3).
